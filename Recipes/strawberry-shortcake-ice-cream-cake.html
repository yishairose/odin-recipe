    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>24 Golden Oreos or vanilla sandwich cookies</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>12 Golden Oreos or vanilla sandwich cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 box Gefen Strawberry Jell or other strawberry gel powder</li>
        <li>pink or red food coloring, such as Gefen (optional)</li>
        <li>1 container vanilla ice cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Line the bottom of a seven-inch springform pan (eight- or nine-inch is fine too) with Gefen Parchment Paper. 
            Spray the sides with oil spray.
        </li>
        <li>Place the cookies in a food processor fitted with the S-blade and pulse into crumbs. 
            Add melted butter and mix until combined.
        </li>
        <li>Press mixture into the bottom of pan. Place in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Take ice cream out of the freezer and place in the fridge to soften.</li>
        <li>Place 10 cookies in the food processor and pulse into large crumbs. Add butter and crumble into pea-sized pieces. 
            Add strawberry gel powder and mix until combined. 
            For a more colorful crumble, add food coloring.
        </li>
        <li>Remove pan from freezer. Scoop half of the vanilla ice cream into the pan and spread evenly. Sprinkle on 1/4 of the strawberry crumble.
             Scoop the other half of the ice cream, spread evenly, and top with the remaining strawberry crumble.
        </li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can skip the middle layer and simply scoop the full container of ice cream onto the crust, spread evenly, 
            and sprinkle on the strawberry crumble.
        </li>
        <li>Freeze and enjoy!</li>
